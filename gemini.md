# Project: Animated Tech Explainers

This project aims to create a series of clear, concise, and visually engaging web pages to explain complex technical concepts.

## Core Components

Each explainer page is built using a combination of tools:

-   **Canva**: For creating short, silent, looping MP4 video animations. These videos demonstrate the *dynamic* part of a concept (e.g., the process of containerization).
-   **Mermaid.js**: For creating declarative, text-based diagrams embedded in the HTML. These diagrams show the *static* structure or relationships in a concept (e.g., the final nested structure of a container on a host).
-   **HTML/CSS**: Provides the structure and styling for the web pages.
-   **GitHub Pages**: Used for free, public hosting of the final website.

## Agent-Assisted Workflow

We are using a Gemini agent to accelerate the development process. The workflow is as follows:

1.  **Conceptualization**: The user provides a technical topic. The agent helps break it down into a simple text explanation, a structural diagram, and a dynamic animation idea.
2.  **Asset Creation**:
    *   The **user** creates the visual animation in Canva based on the storyboard and exports it as an MP4.
    *   The **agent** generates the corresponding HTML page, including the text, the Mermaid.js diagram, and a placeholder for the Canva video.
3.  **Integration**: The user places the exported MP4 from Canva into the `animations` folder. The agent updates the main `index.html` to link to the new explainer page.
4.  **Iteration & Deployment**: The agent assists with refining the content based on feedback and executing the `git` commands to deploy the updated site to GitHub Pages.

This collaborative process allows for rapid prototyping and iteration, combining the agent's coding and content generation capabilities with the user's design skills in Canva.

## Explainer Page Structure

Each concept page should follow this 4-part structure to provide a comprehensive explanation:

1.  **üß† Concept**: A high-level text explanation of the topic and a Mermaid.js diagram showing the static structure.
2.  **üé¨ Animation Idea**: The embedded looping MP4 video showing the concept in action.
3.  **üìù Steps in Canva**: A high-level, numbered list of the animation's components and the Canva effects used.
4.  **üñ±Ô∏è Process in Detail**: A detailed, step-by-step guide on how to create the animation in Canva, including where to click and what to search for.
