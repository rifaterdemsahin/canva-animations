# Local Environment: DaVinci Resolve

This document outlines the local development environment centered around DaVinci Resolve for video production.

## 1. Software

*   **Primary Software**: DaVinci Resolve (Studio or Free version)
*   **Purpose**: Used for more advanced video editing, color grading, and audio mixing that may be beyond the scope of Canva's animation tools.

## 2. Workflow

1.  **Asset Import**: Import assets, such as screen recordings, voice-overs, or animations exported from Canva.
2.  **Editing**: Assemble clips on the timeline, perform cuts, add transitions, and apply effects.
3.  **Color Grading**: Use Resolve's color correction tools to ensure a consistent and professional look.
4.  **Audio**: Mix audio, clean up voice-overs, and add background music.
5.  **Export**: Render the final video in a web-friendly format (e.g., H.264 MP4) for embedding into the explainer pages.

## 3. Hardware Considerations

*   **Operating System**: macOS / Windows
*   **Performance**: A powerful CPU, a dedicated GPU (NVIDIA or AMD), and at least 16GB of RAM are recommended for a smooth editing experience.
*   **Storage**: Fast SSD storage is recommended for project files and cache to prevent playback stutter.
