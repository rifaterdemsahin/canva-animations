# Formula 3: Advanced Video with DaVinci Resolve

This guide explains when and how to use DaVinci Resolve for more complex video needs.

## 1. When to Use DaVinci Resolve

Use Resolve when the explanation requires more than a simple, looping animation. Good use cases include:

*   **Screen Recordings**: When you need to show a user interface or command-line process.
*   **Voice-overs**: For adding narration to your visual explanations.
*   **Combining Clips**: When you need to sequence multiple Canva animations or other video clips together.
*   **Advanced Polish**: For professional color grading and audio mixing.

## 2. Workflow

1.  **Export from Canva**: Export your base animation from Canva as an MP4 with a solid color background (e.g., green or blue) if you need to layer it.
2.  **Import into Resolve**: Create a new project in Resolve and import your Canva animation, screen recordings, and any other media into the Media Pool.
3.  **Assemble on Timeline**: Drag your clips onto the timeline. If you used a green screen, you can use the "3D Keyer" effect in the Fusion or Color page to make the background transparent.
4.  **Add Audio**: Add your voice-over track and any background music. Use the Fairlight page for advanced audio mixing.
5.  **Color Grade**: Use the Color page to correct colors and ensure all clips have a consistent look.
6.  **Export for Web**: Go to the Deliver page. Use the "H.264 Master" or a custom web-preset to export the final video as an MP4.
