# Formula 2: Canva Animation Guide

This guide provides best practices for creating clear and effective animations in Canva for this project.

## 1. Setup

*   **Format**: Use a "Video" preset or a square 1:1 aspect ratio (e.g., 1080x1080px).
*   **Duration**: Keep animations short and looping, ideally between 5-15 seconds.

## 2. Animation Principles

*   **Clarity over Complexity**: The goal is to explain, not to dazzle. Use simple, clear animations.
*   **Focus on One Action**: Each animation should demonstrate a single process or transformation.
*   **Good Animation Choices**: 
    *   **Drift / Pan**: Excellent for showing movement or a journey from point A to B.
    *   **Pop / Rise**: Great for making elements appear with emphasis.
    *   **Wipe**: Perfect for showing a process flow or revealing something.
    *   **Breathe / Pulse**: Useful for drawing attention to a specific element.

## 3. Workflow

1.  **Add Static Elements**: Place all your icons, shapes, and text on the canvas first.
2.  **Animate Elements**: Select each element and apply an animation from the "Animate" panel.
3.  **Sequence with Timeline**: Click "Show timing" at the bottom of the editor. Drag the animation bars on the timeline to sequence them correctly. Ensure one action follows another logically.

## 4. Export

1.  Click **Share** -> **Download**.
2.  Select **MP4 Video** as the file type.
3.  Place the downloaded file into the `/animations` folder in the project.
