# Formula 2: Canva Animation Guide

This guide provides best practices for creating clear and effective animations in Canva for this project.

## 1. Setup

*   **Format**: Use a "Video" preset or a square 1:1 aspect ratio (e.g., 1080x1080px).
*   **Duration**: Keep animations short and looping, ideally between 5-15 seconds.

## 2. Animation Principles

*   **Clarity over Complexity**: The goal is to explain, not to dazzle. Use simple, clear animations.
*   **Focus on One Action**: Each animation should demonstrate a single process or transformation.
*   **Good Animation Choices**: 
    *   **Drift / Pan**: Excellent for showing movement or a journey from point A to B.
    *   **Pop / Rise**: Great for making elements appear with emphasis.
    *   **Wipe**: Perfect for showing a process flow or revealing something.
    *   **Breathe / Pulse**: Useful for drawing attention to a specific element.

## 3. Workflow

1.  **Add Static Elements**: Place all your icons, shapes, and text on the canvas first.
2.  **Animate Elements**: Select each element and apply an animation from the "Animate" panel.
3.  **Sequence with Timeline**: Click "Show timing" at the bottom of the editor. Drag the animation bars on the timeline to sequence them correctly. Ensure one action follows another logically.

### Timeline Best Practices

*   **Access the Timeline**: Click "Show timing" at the bottom of the Canva editor to reveal the timeline view.
*   **Animation Bars**: Each animated element appears as a colored bar showing its duration and start time.
*   **Drag to Sequence**: Click and drag animation bars horizontally to adjust when they start.
*   **Sequential Flow**: For step-by-step animations, align bars end-to-end (previous animation ends when next begins).
*   **Overlap for Smoothness**: Overlap bars by 0.5-1s for smoother transitions between elements.
*   **Stagger Effects**: For multiple similar elements (e.g., commit dots), offset their start times by 0.3-0.5s.
*   **Recommended Durations**:
    *   **Pop/Rise**: 1-1.5s for appearance animations
    *   **Drift/Pan**: 2-3s for movement across the canvas
    *   **Pulse/Breathe**: 1.5-2s for emphasis or continuous effects
    *   **Wipe**: 1.5-2.5s for revealing elements or transitions
*   **Total Video Length**: Aim for 8-15 seconds total to keep animations concise and loopable.

## 4. Export

1.  Click **Share** -> **Download**.
2.  Select **MP4 Video** as the file type.
3.  Place the downloaded file into the `/animations` folder in the project.

## 5. Final Review Checklist

Before downloading your animation, verify these critical elements:

*   **Icon Positioning**: All icons are correctly positioned and remain visible throughout the animation.
*   **Timing & Sequencing**: Animations are timed properly and sequenced in the correct order (verify in timeline view).
*   **Labels & Text**: All labels and text are clear, readable, and large enough at video resolution.
*   **Export Settings**: Export format is MP4 Video with HD resolution (1920x1080 recommended).
*   **Smooth Looping**: If designed to loop, verify the animation transitions smoothly from end to beginning.
